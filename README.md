Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Alberto Vilches, a Full-Stack Software Developer based in Germany and working at Trudesk since 2021.

As a software developer at Trudesk, I work on a help-desk service platform that enables businesses to provide fast and efficient customer support. I use TypeScript, GraphQL, React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to build a high-performance and custom-built API that can handle complex queries and data manipulation, a cloud-based and on-premises SaaS UI with a suite of custom components and hooks, and an easy-to-use developer SDK for React.js applications.

In my free time I enjoy learning languages. My native language is Spanish and I already speak English at full professional proficency so I am working towards reaching that level in German as well.

These are some of the technologies I work with:
